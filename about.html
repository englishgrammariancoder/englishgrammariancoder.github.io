	<p>To the students and faculty : <br><br>
<b><i>There is no greater calling than to teach young people.</i></b><br><br>
This college will no longer honor race or ethnicity.
The only identity this college will recognize is your individual identity your character, your scholarship, your humanity. And the only national identity this college will recognize is Pakistani and Iqra Intermediate College is created to make better Pakistani.
I am not interested in what your native language is? No obscene language will be tolerated anywhere on this college's property. <br> <br>
I am orienting the college toward academics and away from politics and propaganda. No more time will be devoted to tobacco, caffeine, or global warming. No more classes will be devoted to health issue.
And there will be no more attempts to convince you that you are a victim because you are not white or male or have rich background. We will have failed if any one of you passes from this college and does not consider him or herself inordinately lucky to be alive and to be a Pakistani. <br><br>
Now, please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of our country.
And promise yourself that you will have to be a responsible citizen wherever you will be, as you are representing Pakistan. </p>
